# Part 1
1. It will print the value of i after the last loop (prices.length) because var is in the global scope.

2. It will print the value of the discountedPrice from the last loop iteration (calculated with prices[prices.length - 1]) because var is\
in the global scope (not declared in a function).

3. It will print the value of final price in the last iteration of the for loop because final price 

4. It returns [50, 100, 150] because the for loop iterates through the prices and calculates the discounted price; \
then it rounds the price and pushes the new price to the end of the discounted array. The discounted array is returned after\
the loop terminates.

5. It will throw an error because i isn't defined in the scope.

6. It will throw an error because discountedPrice is not declared in the scope.

7. It will print the value of final price in the last iteration of the for loop because final price \
was already declared within the scope and the value is last updated on the last iteration of the for loop. 

8. It returns [50, 100, 150] because the for loop iterates through the prices and calculates the discounted price; \
then it rounds the price and pushes the new price to the end of the discounted array. The discounted array is returned after\
the loop terminates.
